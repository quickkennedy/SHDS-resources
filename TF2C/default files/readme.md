because tf2c is the worst developed sourcemod developed by five blind and deaf gophers, there are 3 overriding folders that tf2c makes use of.

ASSETS VPK - things extracted from `tf2c_assets_dir.vpk`<br>
MISC VPK - things extracted from `tf2c_misc_dir.vpk`<br>
NON VPK - things from the base `tf2classic` folder<br>
